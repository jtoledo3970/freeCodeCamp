## Add Keywords to Your package.json

<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
You should go over to the `package.json` file in your project. Keywords follow a similar convention as this:

```code
"keywords": [
    "freecodecamp",
    "node",
    "express",
  ]
  ...
```
